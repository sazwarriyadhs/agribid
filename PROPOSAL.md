# **Project Proposal: AgriBid - Digital Agricultural Marketplace**

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

**AgriBid** is a comprehensive, role-based digital marketplace designed to modernize Indonesia's agricultural sector. By providing a real-time auction platform, AgriBid directly connects agricultural producers (farmers, ranchers, fishermen) with a wide network of businesses, partners, and verified exporters. The platform integrates advanced AI-powered tools to assist with pricing and export-readiness, while facilitating secure transactions through a centralized admin-verified payment system. AgriBid aims to enhance market transparency, increase producer income, and open up Indonesian agricultural products to a global audience, all within a secure and user-friendly ecosystem.

## **2. Problem Statement**

The traditional agricultural supply chain in Indonesia often suffers from several inefficiencies:
- **Limited Market Access:** Small-scale producers struggle to connect with a broad base of buyers, often relying on a limited number of middlemen, which can suppress prices.
- **Price Opacity:** Lack of transparent pricing mechanisms makes it difficult for producers to ascertain the fair market value of their goods.
- **Barriers to Export:** Complex regulations, lack of knowledge, and difficulty in meeting international standards create significant barriers for producers wishing to enter the global market.
- **Transaction Insecurity:** The absence of a secure, standardized payment system introduces risks for both buyers and sellers.

## **3. Proposed Solution**

AgriBid addresses these challenges by offering a centralized, technology-driven platform that provides:
- **A Transparent Auction Marketplace:** Real-time bidding ensures that prices are determined by supply and demand, allowing producers to achieve the best possible value for their products.
- **Direct Market Linkages:** The platform removes barriers by directly connecting producers to a diverse range of domestic and international buyers.
- **Guided Export Pathway:** A clear, step-by-step process allows successful producers and bidders to become verified exporters, with AI assistance to guide them through legal and transactional requirements.
- **Secure and Standardized Transactions:** All payments are processed through a single, admin-managed joint account (Rekening Bersama), with a clear 10% administration fee, ensuring security and trust for all parties.
